== Description ==

This plugin polls the Octoprint API and displays the status of your 3D printer in a widget or on a page with a shortcode.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the API in the Octoprint settings
2. Copy the API key in the settings fields.
3. Set the URL to access Octoprint, without slash at the end (ex: http://localhost:5000)

If Octoprint is not running on the same server than Wordpress you will need to make Ocotprint accessible for this server. If it is a VM i recommend using a SSH tunnel.
